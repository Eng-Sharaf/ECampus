# Change log

Date: 2025-10-31

- Updated `babel.config.js` to include Reanimated Babel plugin.
  - Before: presets only
  - After: presets + `plugins: ['react-native-reanimated/plugin']`

- Added `react-native-worklets` dependency to `package.json` for Reanimated v4.
  - Initial add: `react-native-worklets@^0.5.2` (build error: incompatible with RN 0.82.x)
  - Updated to: `react-native-worklets@^0.6.0`
  - Final (your edit): `react-native-worklets@^0.6.1`

- No changes were made to `android/gradle.properties` (already had `newArchEnabled=true`).

- Fixed navigator import causing runtime error "createNativeStackNavigator is not a function".
  - In `App.tsx`, changed import from `@react-navigation/stack` to `@react-navigation/native-stack`.

Operational notes (not code changes):
- Cleaned Android build via `./android/gradlew.bat clean` and suggested killing Metro on port 8081.
- Suggested rebuild with `npm run android` and, if needed, starting Metro with `--reset-cache`.
